LinearEquation class

Instance variables:
    private String point1 - represents the first coordinate point
    private String point2 - represents the second coordinate point
    public double m - represents the slope of the equation
    public double b - represents the y-intercept of the equation
    private String equation - represents the slope intercept form of the equation
    private double dis - represents the distance between the 2 coordinate points

Constructor
    public LinearEquation(String p1, String p2) - this is where all the calculations before the third x value takes place

Methods
    public String toString()
        Displays all the information before the third x value which includes:
            Both coordinate points
            The slope
            The y-intercept
            The slope intercept form equation
            The distance between the 2 coordinate points

EquationRunner.java
1. Asks the user for the first coordinate point.
2. "Parses" our both the x and y value of the first coordinate point.
3. Asks the user for the second coordinate point.
4. "Parses" our both the x and y value of the second coordinate point.
5. Creates the new LinearEquation.
6. Prints out all of the LinearEquation's information.
7. Asks the user for a third x value.
8. Uses the previously parsed x and y values with the new x value to calculate the new y value and display the new point created.
